# Turn Order Randomizer

This app is meant to help deciding turn order when playing e.g. board games. The main features are
- Add any number of players
- Randomize turn order
- Random labels to players, e.g.
  - First player marker
  - Seat order (in case the turn order doesn't reflect that)
  - Any other custom text or numeric labels

As an extra feature it also allows you to throw dice. Includes D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 and D20, 
but also you can have any range as well.

## Labels

There are four label types:
- Text
  - Label which can contain any text
- Number
  - Label which has any number range
- Only One
  - Only one label is assigned within all players
- One for Each Player
  - One label is assigned to each player. Like Number, but automatically creates one label for each player.
